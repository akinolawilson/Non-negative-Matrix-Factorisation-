# Non-negative Matrix Factorization

## Overview 
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
This repository contains classes for the dimension reduction technique of non-negative matrix factorization alongside a data pre-processing technique. Three different cost functions have been implemented paired with three different optimisation methods. These are:<br>
*Frobenius norm and non-negative alternating least squares 
<br>
*Kullback-Leibler divergence and gradient descent 
<br>
*Localised divergence and multiplicative updates
<br>
### Prerequisites
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
To make use of the classes, a user would need the following packages:-
* Numpy 
* Scipy

### Further Development and Reading

The next task at hand is decoupling the optimisation methods from the objective functions, such that they can be used independently. A formal review of the models and an example application can be found at my <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338197703_Non-negative_Matrix_Factorization">ResearchGate</a> account.
